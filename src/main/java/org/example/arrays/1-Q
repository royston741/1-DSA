1) Best time to buy and sell stock
- buy pointer =0
- sell pointer =1
- if price at sell > price at buy
    - calculate profit
    - update max profit if needed
- else
    - move buy pointer to sell pointer
- move sell pointer forward

2) contains duplicate
Approach 1
- create a set to store seen numbers
- for each number in the array
    - if number is in set
        - return true
    - else
        - add number to set
- return false

Approach 2
- add all elements to a set
- compare size of set with size of array
- if sizes are different
    - return true
- else
    - return false

3) Product of array except self - Prefix and Suffix product
- crete a prefix array which at each index i contains product of all elements to the left of i
- create a suffix array which at each index i contains product of all elements to the right of i
- for each index i in the original array
    - result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]

4) Maximum subarray - Kadane's Algorithm
- set the current sum and max sum to the first element
- for each element from the second to the last
    - update current sum to be the maximum of the current element and current sum + current element
    - update max sum if current sum is greater than max sum
