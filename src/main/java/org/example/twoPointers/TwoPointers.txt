Two pointers

1) can be a sorted array
2) can b used in linear data structure
3) Use two pointers left and right

Problems:

1) Valid Palindrome
- filter only alphanumeric value
- left pointer at start and right pointer at end
- move left and right pointer towards center
- if characters at both pointers are not equal, return false

2) Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Approach 1
- left pointer points at smallest value
- right pointer points at largest value
- calculate sum of both pointers
- if sum is equal to target, return indices
- if sum is less than target, move left pointer to right
- if sum is greater than target, move right pointer to left

Approach 2
- Use a map to store all the elements of the array
- check the remaining value (target - current element) in the map
- if found, return indices
- else store the element in the map

3) Three sum - find triplets that sum to zero
- sort the array
- iterate through the array with index i
- for each i, set left pointer to i+1 and right pointer to end of array
- calculate sum of nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]
- if sum is zero, add triplet to result and move both pointers
- if sum is less than zero, move left pointer to right
- if sum is greater than zero, move right pointer to left
- use Set to store and remove duplicates.

4) Container With Most Water
- left pointer at start and right pointer at end
- height is determined by the shorter height i.e. min(height[left], height[right])
- width is determined by the distance between left and right pointers i.e. right - left
- calculate area = height * width
- update max area if current area is greater than max area
- move the pointer pointing to the shorter height towards center

5) Trapping Rain Water
- use two pointers left and right at start and end of the array
- maintain two variables leftMax and rightMax to store the maximum height to the left and right of the pointers
- iterate until left pointer is less than right pointer
- check the minimum height in left part and right part and accordingly calculate the trapped water
- if left part is smaller, update leftMax if it is smaller than the height of left pointer
 or calculate water trapped at left pointer (leftmax -  heights[left]) and move left pointer to right
- if right part is smaller, update rightMax if it is smaller than the height of right pointer
or calculate water trapped at right pointer (rightmax - heights[right]) and move right pointer to left
