1) Remove duplicates from sorted array
Approach 1 - Two Pointers
-  [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
- left will point at the last unique element found
- right will explore the array
- if left element != right element, we found a new unique element
- move left pointer forward and copy right element to left position

2) Remove element
- left pointer to tract the index to insert element
- right pointer to track element
- if the right element is not equal to value to remove than insert at left index and increment left

3) Find first occurrence of element in sorted array
Approach 1 - Use string index of
Approach 2 - two pointers
- for every element check if the target string exist starting from that index
- eg: "sadbutsad", "sad"
- At index 0 = s, 1=a, 2=d  => found
- return index 0
- if not found return -1
Approach 3
- foe every index create a substring start with that index and end with the index + target length
- compare the substring with target string
- if found return index else return -1

4) Valid palindrome
- start from both end bring team closer to check if palindrome
